## Project Purpose
The purpose of Phase 2 is to extend the functionality of the CLI tool developed in Phase 1 into a Trustworthy Module Registry, ensuring core functionalities for managing npm-compatible packages. This phase emphasizes building a functional, secure, and efficient baseline for the Trustworthy Module Registry, laying the foundation for future enhancements while meeting the immediate needs of ACME Corporation. Users can upload modules to the registry and download them as needed, with metadata properly logged and managed. Key details such as version, file type, size, and ratings are captured and stored for each module in a DynamoDB database. A standards-compliant API is provided for interacting with the module registry, supporting operations such as querying, uploading, and downloading packages. The system is deployed on AWS using S3 for storage, Lambda functions for backend logic, and DynamoDB for metadata storage, ensuring scalability and reliability. A simple, accessible web interface is introduced to facilitate user interactions with the registry.
